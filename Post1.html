                <h4 class = "h4font">The Big Sort</h4>

                <a href = "https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/news/article/the-big-sort-2024-volunteers">The Big Sort</a> involved 
                going to Grant House (Pollock) (in case you didn't know... lol) and going through all the things left by 
                students. First we sorted bed stuff (pillows, duvets, sheets). After that we went through clothes. And 
                finally everything else (food, appliances, other home stuff). There were sooo many hangers! 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                EUSA had made a bingo board for us. Every time we found an item that fit one of the categories, we would 
                take photos. I believe there is a thank you event next week where we will go over the photos. I found a 
                tutu that ticked one of the boxes (though I don't remember which).

                Some other interesting items were a <u>tiny</u> vial of whisky

                and airpods (they were mismatched & found in a bottle of soap).

                <h4 class = "h4font">To Do List</h4>

                Once home from <b>The Big Sort</b>, I decided to write up a to do list of things to do before Elena was 
                home, since the flat was a bit messy. Unfortunately, (though also fortunately), I did two of these before 
                deciding to make lunch and ready your first blog post. This ended up being a many hour long process. I 
                later decided to take advantage of the nice weather and go to the Meadows. 
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\Light.jpg" style="width:300px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>The day was so nice that I opened the window to let in fresh air. As you can see, it was beautiful.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                On the way, I dropped off some of the party aquisitions at the <a href = "https://www.google.com/maps/place
                /Bethany+Christian+Trust/@55.9393424,-3.1819044,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c77f5786b923:0x4b732a4565045b79!8

                </figure>
                
                I then sat in the Meadows (in the sun) reading through messages of yours & responding to them. As it was 
                actually too bright, I moved into the library to continue. 
                


                <h4 class = "h4font">Work</h4>

                I went to work. I left the library with under 10 minutes to get there and somehow made it on time (ie I 
                walked only slightly faster than usual). I then worked, but honestly I don't remember any details. So that 
                was that.
                <br>


                <h4 class = "h4font">Evening</h4>

                I think I called someone? And then, I don't know, they bored me to sleep or something. Not sure. All I 
                remember was starting to write up my response as an email. Oh and I had dinner, bread pudding I think. I'm 
                getting ahead of myself!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Before sleeping, other things happened. There was a beautiful prolonged simple sunset. 
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\Sunset.jpg" style="width:300px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>My (very short) walk to Otis's included a beautiful sky.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\Sunset2.jpg" style="width:300px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>The sunset through one of Otis's kitchen windows.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                More excitingly, there was brewing work to do! I went to Otis's to bottle what turned out to be 12+ litres 
                of beer. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                We had bottles to clean & sterilise:

                </figure>
                
                We then siphoned the contents of the three demijohns into the (sterile) bucket, and then added sugar, and 
                finally we bottled up all the beer!

                </figure>
                
                Back at home is when I fell asleep. That was my day!

                I felt very good about how productive I'd been. I was quite busy, on time to everything, it was a pretty 
                day, we talked a lot (I fell asleep on call, which was really very nice).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!
