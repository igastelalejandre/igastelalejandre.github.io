                <a href = "https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/news/article/the-big-sort-2024-volunteers">The Big Sort</a> involved 
                going to Grant House (Pollock) (in case you didn't know... lol) and going through all the things left by 
                students. First we sorted bed stuff (pillows, duvets, sheets). After that we went through clothes. And 
                finally everything else (food, appliances, other home stuff). There were sooo many hangers!

                EUSA had made a bingo board for us. Every time we found an item that fit one of the categories, we would 
                take photos. I believe there is a thank you event next week where we will go over the photos. I found a 
                tutu that ticked one of the boxes (though I don't remember which).
