                I know people who have cruised (even who cruise!) and they are nice. But I hate cruises & I hate the people 
                on them (I'm told I'd change my mind on one, I doubt it).

                I'm sure the cows are similarly surprised (and potentially intrigued) by the presence of so many humans.

                Cows are surprisingly silent! It is always a jolt when they moo loudly. And it is very surprising for their 
                size.

                This is the section I had to reread when I first skimmed over. Thought it said something about having sex 
                with the cows. Anyway...
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                This is, on close reading, an incredible paragraph. One might even say, a work of art. I'll admit 
                dramatisation for the joke, but truly so funny. Wow. :) Love you (lots!)

                I hope these cows stay there long enough for you to not see them sold. But if they do, perhaps the final 
                domino towards vegetarianism.

                I was going to write about the following in <a href = "Response3.html"><q>A Response To: <q>Cows</q> - 3 
                June 2024</q></a>, but when I got to this section, I forgot. SO here goes! On my famous November Peebles 
                walk, in the end section we had to walk through a field full of sleeping (?) cows, in the dark. For some 
                reason, this was particularly scary. They were relatively close to us and deadly quiet. I remember walking 
                quickly through while trying to be quiet and not look at them. I survived. (It was actually perfectly 
                fine.)
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I really enjoy the Beef & Dairy references!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I'm excited to see all these things live. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!

                Really in the flow of things! :) Here is my original hand-written <a

                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I like the automatic nesting of quotes putting single quotes within double. I do not like that I discovered 
                this today when I wanted <q>Cows</q> to be double quoted as it is originally (see above in <b>My Own 
                Thoughts</b>), but I've decided to ignore that slight discrepancy (and for some reason point it out to 
                you).
