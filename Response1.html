        <p>
            <b>Flying</b><br>

            [pretty photo, well shot] -- propellers <br>
            I'd love to take a plane to Kirkwall just to watch the propellers! Unfortunately not worth the price. I wonder why they don't use slightly smaller planes? I do like that they emptyness brings about conversation with co-travellers. But perhaps that is you and your easy conversing. Note: tell airport boy story ( not as interesting as the title). <br>
            I like your comment on Manchester's idyllicism. I thought the same and then read it. Very funny :) <br>
            Kirkwall's airport seems to be even smaller than Zaragoza's! Haven't been to it in a while, so may be somewhat wrong, but it was literally one room. Tall ceilings did make it feel more spacious though (from my short, young height). Note: tell Zaragoza airport story, 2010. Alright, a quick google search has shown me that actually Zaragoza's airport is much bigger than I remember, which is still sort of tiny. But it's much nicer than Kirkwall's. I think Spain has lots of nice airports, lots of glass and high ceilings. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Driving</b><br>
            Reading this section I had my second jolt of wow, I really like how you write. "Don't forget to put out the bin on Wednesday." The straightforwardness, the slight humour, the fact that things don't flow continuously beautifully, which is beautiful. :) :) ♡ <br>
            <br>

            <b>The Cathedral</b><br>
            I appreciate the hyperlink, it prompted me to (half) read the Wikipedia article in which I learned about the dungeons, which I now very much want to see. <br>
            I'm impressed by the cathedral's age, and curious to see the evolution of time in its architectural styles. <br>
            [beautiful photo, so green, lush, wonderfully composed] -- vines <br>
            [humour, again, I want to kiss you] -- red <br>
            The excerpt from Wikipedia is itself quite humorous too. Really only in its matter-of-factness and the "thing (assembly)", curious if "(assembly)" was added by another. <br>
            The St Magnus Way! Sounds great! I love when walks have pathstones & logos. El Camino De Santiago has a great one: ***** (with lines in yellow on a dark blue background) Unsure if I said this in Oban (or another time), but named routes also very much irresistible for me. (to me?) Also, (hehe :)) I did keep changing Magnus to Mungus in my head up until now. <br>
            [again, super pretty photos! the doors seem comically narrow for such ornate archways/entrances] -- arches (2) <br>
            I very much appreciate your Stockbridge mention + recollection. <br>
            ["portals to the sky", god, I love you] -- portal <br>
            I wonder why the water-gate archway has that name. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Around the Cathedral</b><br>
            On reading this section, I must say I may disagree about the cathedral being the prettiest part of Kirkwall. The house in this section looks lovely! I obviously love the vines. I love coloured windows & doors. I very much like the stone. The gate, the stoned up window or maybe door on the street. So so cute. The crooked windows! (Love the word "blustery".) <br>
            [an image that made me smile] -- house <br>
            [lovely variety of plants, love the swallowing of the window, only missing you in its reflection] -- window <br>
            [the very crooked doorframe, the colourful plant pots, the bright poppies! vines, a watering can, the door knocker, even the stained glass, though maybe not the nicest of stained glass] -- door <br>
            [I would love a railway or block colour poster of Orkney, in fact I think I'd like postcards in that style of all the places we go to together] -- posters <br>
            ["Poundstretcher" sounds like a knock-off "Poundland"] -- bargain <br>
            [is this shop actually called "Orkney Photograph", or have you purposefully left out the y? Regardless, I liked] -- *****camera***** <br>
            Recently I was thinking about how local supermarkets are missing so much, word are quite cramped, but also seem to never have what you need. So what do they sell? Tins and tins of baked beans, soups, spaghetti-os, it seems. Then large supermarkets are huge and don't seem to have much more. I feel they just don't want to stock much more, so they widen the aisles (immensly). I miss non plastic packaged fruit & veg and more variety of those things. And also cheese counters. My childhood holiday memories are filled (!) with these. I'm glad the coöp had eggs. Unsurprised the member price is the same, surprised regular price is. Is Orkney as of yet same prices? I'm always surprised to find lack of fluctuations in supermarket prices across Scotland (other than small to large shops). <br>
            <br>

            <b>Weather</b><br>
            I particularly like your sentences at the beginning of this section. Good style (humour). Wind turbines! So exciting! The story I think I never finished on the bus from Glasgow to Edinburgh was this: when I was younger, my cousins and I would play wind turbine counting games (very simple, one just counts the turbines and whomever counts the most wins). We never set a time limit because we always got into too high number & got bored. On drive from Fife to Queensferry a few weeks ago, I told Otis this and we played (well... we is an overstatement). I counted 33, he got 3. I won. I always think of how funny it is that Spain has so much wind power and Scotland has focused more on solar (from my biased solar research last summer anyway). <br>
            [Beautiful!!!! bend] -- bend <br>
            "Constitutional", a word I'd like to use. <br>
            Must say, I've seen uch odder weather, very Scottish as you say. <br>
            [This kind of grass is very pretty. I like the colours in the photo] -- grass <br>
            "Fond of the effect" makes me melt just a little (I must be careful not to overuse the word melt, note). <br>
            [Very, very, very pretty photograph, I notice now these are all camera photos and not phone.] -- ferry <br>
            <br>

            <b>Closing Thoughts</b><br>
            The old grocer is very cool.
