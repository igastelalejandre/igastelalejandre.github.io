                Reading these first few sentences while seeing the image below was very funny.

                I love to imagine you putting on the waterproofs backwards, fumbling around, maybe dropping them, picking them up, and putting them on again only to find them on backwards <u>again</u>! All the while getting a bit soaked.

                I like the style of the specially made aside aside aside the most. Heehee :)

                I believe Scotland's specialty foods in general stick to beige, both baked good (shortbread & oatcakes) and cheese (though often not dry) and beer (which sometimes is sweet). When I think Scottish food, I occasionally (like now) think of strawberries, potentially now more so because I had for breakfast.
