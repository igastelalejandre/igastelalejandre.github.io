                Reading these first few sentences while seeing the image below was very funny.

                I love to imagine you putting on the waterproofs backwards, fumbling around, maybe dropping them, picking them up, and putting them on again only to find them on backwards <u>again</u>! All the while getting a bit soaked.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I like the style of the specially made aside aside aside the most. Heehee :)

                I believe Scotland's specialty foods in general stick to beige, both baked good (shortbread & oatcakes) and cheese (though often not dry) and beer (which sometimes is sweet). When I think Scottish food, I occasionally (like now) think of strawberries, potentially now more so because I had for breakfast.

                Buildings do interest me.

                [fascinating that you consider the step-y roofs to be very British as I recall being told that that style was dutch when learning New York City history in 2nd (or so) grade and have ever since had my eyes always noticing that] -- <i>roof</i>

                Shale pavements are scary! When wet, super slippy (in my experience). A strange pick for wet isles.

                <h4 class = "h4font">My Own Thoughts</h4>

                My only question is, why was it significant that you took a photo of the fish? My first though was that it was related to me (my contact name in your phone). My second thought, well, I didn't really have one. I thought it would be cleared up later in the post. I was wrong. Alas!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!

                <h4 class = "h4font">Notes</h4>

                Here is my original hand-written <a href="Handwritten Scans\Hand-Written Response 5.pdf">response</a>. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Technically this was an exciting response to write because I learned about HTML anchor links. This was not easy. In fact, as I write this, I have not yet figured out how to make them work. However, I will at some point soon, I'm sure. And then I will use them loads! 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Otherwise, I have typed up this response approximately a month and a half after writing it, so I basically had no idea what I was writing about. I will try to keep myself from not taking so long because the writing them up is not the most fun in these cases.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Also, I'd like to add that the other famous Scottish foods are tablet (definitely beige) and haggis, neeps, and tatties (brown to beige, sometimes a dull orange, usually all drowned with a beige sauce).
