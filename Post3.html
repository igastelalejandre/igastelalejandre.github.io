                <h4 class = "h4font">Writing</h4>

                When I woke up this morning, my plan was to meet Lalit at 10 or so to learn to weld and then have him over for lunch while my bathroom got repainted. Unfortunately, it was raining (the welding was being done outside). Fortunately, I now had a project I really wanted to work on: my website!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                After some procrastination, I made myself breakfast.

                    <figcaption>For breakfast I had toast with clotted cream and marmalade (delicious!) and tea.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                I then sat down in the living room to eat & write. I did not move for about two hours.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3908.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                Finally, just before Lalit was set to arrive, I decided I needed to be prepared for him (that is, shower and buy some veg). I somehow was ready when he arrived.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                At this point, I hadn't enjoyed cooking in a <u>while</u>. I didn't feel inspired. I was sort of scared to cook for him. But, I just went on autopilot and bang! Had so much fun! <u>And</u> the food was incredible!

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3909.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                    <figcaption>This lunch was unimaginably good.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                After our lunch, Lalit and I looked at my photos and Lalit selected some for him to keep, including my laptop's background photo so that he could use it for his too. Matching!


                <h4 class = "h4font">Cleaning</h4>

                One thing I'd been putting off was to move all of your food into my cupboard. It had now been sitting on the table for a good week. I think absentmindedly I started moving those things around, and before I'd really thought og it, I was in the midst of organising <u>our</u> food!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                As I started doing this, Lalit decided he too wanted to clean, and he proceeded to take out all the bins, <u>clean</u> the bins, and hoover! No one has ever done that kind of thing before (no one in his position). He offered to clean our shoer drain & do a variety of other tasks, but he ended up having to leave.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3916.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>The day cleared up beautifully! I love the specks of light on the side of the window sill.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Upon finishing my cleaning up, I realised it was almost SÃ¶derberg pick up time. I hurried off to do that, and then dropped it all off at Otis's before eating a pastry on my way to work.

                </figure>


                <h4 class = "h4font">Work</h4>                

                This was a very good work day. I'd recently been asked if I liked cooking, and having said yes, Elad had me make some cookies. So, after my usual cleaning & laundry, I got to work on that. However! They had run out of ground cinnamon. At first, Elad suggested I grind up the cinnamon sticks in the mortar & pestle, but then he had the great idea of having me make a special spice mix to use instead of just cinnamon. So, I spent over half an hour making this mix (which was very fun), before making the cookie dough and adding the new spice mix.

                    <img src="Images\Mortar&Pestleing.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>They have a silicone mat to put the mortar and pestle on so that it doesn't slip around, which works quite well. Overall it wasn't the most pleasant experience because the powders would fly up into my face and make my nose itch.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                And then, we decided to make the cookies a tray bake instead. So really they became oatmeal raisin bars in the end!

                <h4 class = "h4font">Walking Home</h4>

                I had probably planned to call you on the way home, but you were asleep. For the best because I ended up walking home slowly with camera in hand. I would look around and take photos of anything interesting. It was a warm clear evening and many people had their windows open. I took many photos of the windows, as you will see.

                I really like the effect of not using night mode when it is getting dark. It creates a beautiful sky.

                <h4 class = "h4font">Back Home</h4>

                Once home, I immediately ignored my hunger and went back to writing. Quickly, I realised I did have to eat, so I took out some bread pudding to eat as I worked. Midway through eating it, I realised I had some food stuck to my tooth. I tried to scratch it off, but it wouldn't budge. Then I realised it was not a protrusion. My tooth had chipped! A look in the mirror solidified this.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                For some reason, my greatest physical fear at the moment (but for years) is losing a tooth, with chipping them a close second. So much so that my worst dreams centre around this idea. Fair to say, I was not happy about this turn of events and even a bit stressed. 
            </p>

                <h4 class = "h4font">Closing Thoughts</h4>

                While Lalit and I had lunch, the painter came by to paint two more layers. Now the bathroom looks great and the flat looks good! Very happy about that. This was especially the case because I got through more of my to do list. I was very impressed by my reorganising to the extent of getting almost all our food into my cupboard!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I was so grateful for Lalit's help. It was so unexpected while also being very in-line with who he is. I love Lalit so much. He is such an incredible friend and person. I feel really very cool being able to say that I am his friend (one of the closest!). I'm really going to miss him a lot. Next year will honestly be really strange. Not just because he'll be gone, but because it will be the final year (gasp!) and we will live together and stuff. Wow. I'm really excited! But I am sad about time passing. In some ways, Lalit is so unique. I don't think I could ever find a person like him. He is so generous! And I think he's shaped how I seem myself more than anyone else. I'm so grateful for that. I think I love, like, appreciate myself so much more because of him. :( <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5zcPCsnVQ6shFeknvs5HBu?si=acc60a8e508b4331">I'm sad, but I'm glad to have a good reason for it</a>. Plus, I'll hopefully see him in London this summer! And it gives me another reason to visit England. (The most important one.)
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Lalit also really liked the lunch! It was so so good! I was happy to have enjoyed making it & the result because I had not enjoyed food making in a while. And then I got to cook at work too! That was fun. Making the spice mix was a bit extra, and I don't actually think it made a big difference, but it was really very fun! The process also made me feel more comfortable at work (in their home) and with all of them!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                It was also really very enjoyable walking home. I really like how taking lots of photos has opened my eyes even more to detail! Or maybe that's because I'm happy & look for (subconsciously) beauty around us. Regardless of the reason, I'm really enjoying this freeing walking. It feels very calm.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Really, other than the chipped tooth, this was a really good day. I think it left a good mark on me, from what I can tell as I write this days later.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!

                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I have added this section to my <b>Posts</b> now too. I think it's useful to have, particularly since I am including the scans. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I wrote this entry several weeks ago, but typing it up today, I felt like I was reliving the day again. At times I also remembered the writing of the post clearly. In particular when typing up my <b>Closing Thoughts</b>, I remembered clearly how I felt. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                It's actually been quite nice to look back at this after some time. I am in the position of changing what I wrote, which I have done just a tiny bit to clarify some sentences, but I suppose my real reason for adding this section, <b>Notes</b>, is to give myself a place to add/explain more. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Lalit has become one of my closest friends this year. Sort of unexpectedly. You don't know about our friendship first year, but there was some miscommunication at the beginning that kept us apart. Then he went to Cornell, and we texted some but not much, more so because of him.... I saw Lalit in Brooklyn last summer. It was somewhat a strange experience. A bit odd, but nice. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Otis, Lalit, and I had always been a group, and apparently (a bit surprisingly), Lalit considered our relationship a cornerstone, perhaps he felt similarly to how you did about Mia and Max. When we broke up he was really affected. But then it was fine, once he believed us that nothing was changing for him. However, this did result in us spending more time with Lalit individually, in particular me, because I had always been the one who talked to him and made the plans, and I continued in that way.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                When Ollie broke up with me, I told Lalit first. He came to my flat and sat with me while I cried in silence. I don't think he knew what to do. I remember feeling surprised because he wasn't really doing anything that made me feel much better. Milosz came a bit after and he was better. Ha. This isn't very Lalit complimentary. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                This semester Lalit has become a core friend. He occupies a position no one has before, one I didn't know existed. Maybe if I had siblings I would feel he was an honourary one. But that doesn't feel all that right either (though maybe because I cannot imagine thinking so highly of a family member).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Lalit is probably the only person I feel I can communicate in literally any way with. If we don't speak for weeks, no one is offended. I never feel stressed about sending messages for a week straight and not getting responses. With everyone else who I consider really close friends, I do feel bad if I bombard them with texts for days. Or if not, it is because we carry a constant conversation (sort of the case with you). I think the real difference is that if we don't successfully support each other it's ok. Like with my breakup and Milosz helping. Sometimes we provide the support the other needs. But when that happens, it's never out of obligation but because we naturally do the right things. There isn't really an expectations in our friendship. It's sort of freeing. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I believe Lalit sees me exactly as I want to be. Perhaps I am not there yet and he is seeing ahead, but it gives me belief in myself.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                If Lalit gets married, I will have this to look back to for my speech, which I have finally been promised.
