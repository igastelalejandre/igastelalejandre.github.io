                <h4 class = "h4font">A Tired Morning</h4>

                Before a hike, a good night's rest is recommended, so that's exactly what I didn't do. When my alarm went off at 7:45, I was tempted to text Otis to postpone our meeting. But, I did not. Fortunately (as I would later learn)! 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Finally, past 8, I got out of bed (not my fault at <u>all</u>, I was distracted texting, forced, not by my own volition). Approximately 10 minutes before my meeting with Otis, I was standing in my kitchen with my untouched breakfast, wearing my glasses & pyjamas, altogether unprepared for a hike.

                </figure>

                Somehow I got everything together by 8:50, met Otis, took some random bus, and managed to make it to the <a href = "https://www.lothianbuses.com/timetable/?service_name=X5">X5</a> with time to spare!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                At the bus stop, it started to rain. This was quite worrying. Fortunately, the stop had an awning.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Once on the bus, I was hit with such a wave of sleepiness that I fell asleep.


                <h4 class = "h4font">North Berwick</h4>

                My only other time in North Berwick involved running late to get to Onno's for a wine potluck thing. Leaving North Berwick is not the crispest of memories. Thus, this was my first time actually seeing (definitely exploring) the place. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                The early (in quotes) morning had left me with no time for lunch, which was definitely <u>not</u> my fault. As proof: Otis also had not had time to prepare lunch. We decided to have a true hiking lunch (bread, cheese, tomatoes, things). I also was on the hunt for a banana. Our first stop was <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eRqM7BrpRMj2WJtx5">coop</a>. Realising the town was nice, we were on holiday, etc., we decided to find a better option. We left empty handed. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Our first stop was <a href="https://www.wnclub.co.uk/">Why Not</a>, sorry, <a href="https://www.whynotscotland.com/">whynot?</a> Here, I spied a cheese counter! My favourite! We bought nothing. At this point, it was cloudy and I was a bit cold. I figured I'd warm up once walking constantly (up a hill). Otis and I talked about North Berwick being a posh place, which would suggest nice things in the charity shops. I wanted to hurry on to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XLP8GhQ3Qbu2w3678">bakery</a> I'd found for bread, but we stopped at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/4GEtVDuR6P3hMtwX6">Cancer Research</a> and I relented. I then bought a jumper (now my point about the cold is relevant). This resulted in me being the <u>perfect</u> temperature (for a while). I was chuffed.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                On our walk to the bakery, I saw several puffin postcards (actually one of these was in whynot? and the other was in our <u>real</u> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GYSm1tRVTzAuGbAr9">first stop</a>, or the first stop after the coop: an art and nice things shop which we entered for the largely advertised cafe, which turned out to no longer exist, permanently it seemed) (We were looking for a cafe at first for some reason, I no longer remember why, but it was <u>not</u> for coffee, that comes later, spoiler!).

                    <figcaption>The puffin postcard from whynot?</figcaption>
                </figure>

                I've just realised the first puffin postcard isn't from that shop. These are the postcards from that shop:

                    <img src="Images\IMG_1653.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>I really liked the colours here and the blocky colour aesthetic.</figcaption>

                    <img src="Images\IMG_1654.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                I'm not sure if I'm right about that actually. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Anyway, back to whynot?, outside, on the glass window, they'd painted pretty flowers, which I (not very 
                well) photographed:

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\IMG_1656.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Inspiration for my mirror?</figcaption>
                </figure>

                So, back to outside Cancer Research! I'd bought the jumper. I was happy! We still needed to get our lunch things. We also wanted to buy coffee. On the way to the bakery we stopped in a few shops. Bought nothing. We arrived at the bakery! I realised I'd actually found this bakery months ago online and had added it to a list of <a href = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/jRYfn8C3UqFwTEQX7">places I want to go to</a>! So I was very happy to be ticking it off my list accidentally. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                There was delicious bread, we bought a loaf.

                <figure>

                </figure>

                And incredible looking pastries and things. 

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\IMG_1659.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Honestly, I want to try all of these.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                We bought a pistachio raspberry cruffin (mine) and a kougin amann (Otis's, on my recommendation).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                The inside of this shop was very aesthetic, as you can imagine from the bread photo. Unfortunately, I didn't take more photos, but you can check online.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                As we'd come on this hike quite unprepared (actually Otis had tomatoes, so there was <u>some</u> food), we needed to get our loaf sliced. Otis was sure they would slice it for us. They would not. Well, they did. But originally they would not. Let me explain. I asked them to slice it. The person working there said they weren't allowed to. We must've looked sad when we said <q>oh</q> in response. I think we also explained we were going on a hike & had no knife (I know, I know, unprepared). They looked around and then said <q>ok, how many slices</q>? And then even though we said four was enough, they sliced a few more! This was so very kind of them! I felt heart-warmed. Though I do wonder why they aren't allowed to cut bread. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Upon leaving the shop, Otis and I excitedly pulled out a slice of bread to share. It was <u>amazing</u>. So incredibly good. Not painful to eat. Not super sour. Delicious crumb texture. It was glorious. Otis believes it is the best sourdough he's ever tried. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                We ambled back towards whynot? to get some cheese (having decided they had the best of the cheese counters).

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\IMG_1661.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                We decided to make our final stop at a pretty coloured <a href = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/qPi7yVKA8Q92rCYa7">cafe</a> for some flat whites. (if you've been following, you will notice that we really zigzagged our way along this street, very efficient.)
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Now finally laden with food and supplies, we headed south towards Berwick Law. Here, finally, I remembered that I had my camera in my possession, and my photographs <u>should</u> better in the remainder of this post.

                The day was starting to look up. Behind us were some blue skies, the temperature was nice, up ahead approached the hill. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                We had decided to walk without checking the maps, a new like of mine I really recommend (as you already know + have experienced + have influenced).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                We stumbled across some red poppies. The first I'd seen this year! I'm sure I squealed. My camera unfortunately was unable to pickup the colour of them (vibrant), and the wind (though quite gentle) pushed the flowers around to no end. The result: 

                <figure>

                Next to this section of housing was a patch of trees with a beautiful path going through.

                Otis even took photos of me!

                </figure>

                The path led us to a house (actually many, but one in particular) which had its very own wildflower bee meadow! Made for me!

                <figure>

                Having not yet bought a banana, I was happy to know that Otis knew (from a previous map search) of an Aldi nearby. On our way in the direction we hoped it would be, I took this photo:

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3822.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                (Actually it was after the Aldi.)
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                So we got to Aldi! But their bananas were all very green. We left. Otis recalled a Tesco nearby! On the way I took that photo. And more!

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3828.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                With bananas acquired (Tesco pulled through), we could finally make our way to Berwick Law. But look! A funny sign!

                    <figcaption>It feels like the sign is trying to rush off the pavement and onto the road!</figcaption>
                </figure>

                We walked along a road for a few minutes, first approaching the hill, and slowly surpassing it on its eastern side.

                As the clouds dissipated, the day grew warmer, we shed our clothes.

                Fortunately, a nice breeze kept us at a very good temperature. This breeze also waved around the long grass, rippling endlessly. It was beautiful.

                The road had crested its hill and on turning west, we passed by some houses, now walking on pavement! One of the houses had a nice gate.

                </figure>

                Across from which, I presume, were its sheep.

                </figure>

                At the end of these houses, the road turned south once more. Seeing an opening in the stone wall, we decided to turn onto a field and head straight for Berwick Law. Fortunately, this was the right move, as this field had another opening onto the next, with a clear path leading to the hill. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Along this path were some pretty square-shaped trees. An informative sign said nothing much of interest, see below:

                But the trees were pretty.

                </figure>

                As we reached the point of inflection, we realised it was time for lunch. So, having found quite a nice area, we sat down.

                Surprise! I told the story wrong! We both had other food! Not sure what this is, but looks like butter beans & rice (and I remember it had olives, yum).

                As we ate, the sky clouded over again, and it started to rain lightly.

                I preferred to spend my post lunch time taking photos of the snails.

                </figure>

                Our stomachs sufficiently satiated, we packed up and continued on our way. The options were, go straight up the side (very steep)

                <figure>

                or take the windy way up.

                We chose the latter.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                On our way up, we passed the trees I'd seen from a distance that looked funny & spindly.

                As well as other trees.

                </figure>

                Now on the south side of the hill, we found ourselves in ever increasing wind. And also, lots of cool rocks!

                </figure>

                But back to the wind. It was really, very windy. Hard to hear anything kind of wind. Get very close to the ground and lean forwards when stepping up kind of wind. It was fun! And beautiful!

                </figure>

                Well, we kept climbing up, at the end mostly on the less windy eastern side, and once up, sheltered behind some rocks so as to not be blown away (literally, unfortunately the monument at the top is ugly and won't figuratively blow anyone away).

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3892.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                From our shelter, we looked out at the view and tried to figure out how far we could see (not that far it turns out).

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3891.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>At first we were convinced we could see land on the horizon here (we definitely could not).</figcaption>
                </figure>

                I ate my second banana.

                </figure>

                And Otis ate his kougin amann (it was very good).

                </figure>

                After our snacks, we decided it necessary to officially touch the summit (and also see views from the other side). Here you can see my sheltering still blew my hair everywhere.

                At the very top I took some nice photos.

                And attempted to show how windy it was.

                These attempts are perhaps more effective.

                On the northern side, slightly farther down than the wale bone obelisk, there were some war lookout buildings (if I recall correctly), definitely some building structures of some sort. Unfortunately left unphotographed (but perhaps a reason to return).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Alas, it was really a bit too windy. We had had our fun flying on the wind a bit. We now wanted to return to the town.

                Remember we had two options going up the hill? Well, we decided to take the steep path down. This was maybe not the best of ideas, as going downhill is not the time to pick the steep path. Spoiler alert: no one died!

                Here, we met an old lady with whom we talked for a while. She told us about the ponies in the area. She was very sweet & offered to take some photos of us. Unfortunately, she videoed instead! I then had Otis film me going over the many fences needing passing.

                We went down the rest of the hill, now a more gentle descent. At the edge of the park-y bit, we exited via gap in stones.

                As we ate, we had a nice view of some high school students. They weren't actually all that interesting. There was, however, a play park with a climbing wall where the holds were, we think, green lobsters. Let me know what you think.

                </figure>

                Stomachs once again full, we continued on our way. Now, by walking through a graveyard. This graveyard's church was clearly no longer in use, but the building was very cool. It was full of openings to the sky.

                Once out of the graveyard, we spotted a sign for a garden centre / tools shop. They were selling tomatoes! We were tempted to buy for permaculture. 

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\TomatoesForSale.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                What seemed like a small shop

                turned out to be very large (and crammed full!).

                They were selling a wide variety of seeds, including poppies

                ...plants. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                They also had paint samples. I had fun picking four to put on my wall. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                However, we had to leave! Duty called! So, on we went. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Finally back in town, we stopped to refill our bottles. A Scottish Water tap had excitingly been rated with <q>quality</q>.

                Or they'd chosen that spot carefully.

                On the way to the water, I saw this cute sign:

                and many cute houses

                    <figcaption>This interestingly reminded me of the tiles in doorways in Amsterdam.</figcaption>

                as well as some pretty artwork in a window.

                </figure>

                Now, finally, we'd made it to the beach! Unfortunately, the bus we wanted to take was leaving in 15 minutes, so we could only walk through quickly. Still, it was a wonderful day and a beautiful beach and I enjoyed it immensely.

                At the bus stop, we noticed no signage for our bus. Worried, we hurried down the road to the next stop. This one <u>did</u> have a notice for our bus. As we had some time to wait still, I took out my book (<i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>) to read. This was theoretically very enjoyable, but not in practice (because I don't like the book).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Suddenly, we noticed the bus approach, and turn right before our stop! Again, worried, we hurried to the next stop. Though hurrying, I did stop to take photos of the flowers.

                At the third bus stop, it smelled terribly. Fortunately, it was a short wait. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Once on the bus, I read for a while. I had been invited to Portobello for a bonfire for Adela's birthday and had yet not decided whether I'd go. I wanted to, but I was tired, had work later, and my phone was low on battery. Once reading on bus, I realised just how tired I was, and decided to go straight home.

                <h4 class = "h4font">Creating A Website</h4>

                While on Berwick Law, I'd decided I really wanted to respond to your blog posts on my own website (and had also decided I wanted to write my own). So! With help from Otis to set up the github, I made me own personal website!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I also ate my cruffin.

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>This was so incredibly ridiculously delicious, I hope we go and can get the same.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                It was <u>so</u> incredible. I let Otis try and he said he regretted his purchase. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                But back to the website. I spent the entire rest of the day (about 8 hours), sitting writing up my first response and finally sharing it with you! (I was supposed to have work, but right before leaving, Elad texted to say I wasn't needed. This was great!)

                This was an <u>incredible</u> day. Even now, almost two weeks later, I still cherish it so much. Berwick Law was better than I expected! And North Berwick is so cute. There was much left to explore. I hope very much to return later this summer, hopefully with you. &#9825 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Deciding to buikd my own website, learn html & css, was such a good decision! I'm so happy with it! I feel really proud of it. I remember the excitement of sharing it so well, and it continues to do so. I'm really just super happy & super proud. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!
