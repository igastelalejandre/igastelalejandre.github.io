                <h4 class = "h4font">The Morning</h4>

                Once actually out of bed, which wasn't at a ridiculous time for once, I went into the kitchen to make my breakfast. My high hopes were quickly slashed as I found no eggs and milk that had gone off. So, after putting on some more washing, I headed out to coop.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                With eggs and milk procured (without vouchers unfortunately), I headed home to eat.

                </figure>

                While/post breakfasting, I did some tasks and some writing. The tasks were: finally buy all my tickets for the summer! And cancelling the stupid train discount account thing.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                At noon, marks were supposed to com out. For once, they did! Also, for once, I actually checked them immediately. 


                <h4 class = "h4font">Errands Around Town</h4>

                Otis and I had decided to finish our errands walk. The one that had started a week and a half previously. Our first step was my backpack! Instead, while passing the library, we decided to go in to get our cards. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                We had both applied for cards in October-ish and we were a bit worried that the long wait would cause issues. Fortunately, it did not. 

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4279.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Interestingly shaped card.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                The woman who gave us our cards also asked if we knew our pins. Neither of us did. She then proceeded to say them out loud to us in a very quiet library. It was pretty comical.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                With cards safely stowed, we explored a little. That is, I went to the bathroom (not very exciting).

                    <img src="Images\DSCN4280.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                    <figcaption>And windows! Complete with sun streaming in!</figcaption>
                </figure>

                One thing that caught our eye was a book with an advertisement on the front cover.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4284.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                With that ticked off our list, we headed to Tiso.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4286.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>I love framing buildings with trees.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                We were at Tiso for a while as I took a while to pick between two bags.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\BagMirrorPic.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Once decided, I was very excited to have my new bag!</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Of course, once I'd purchased the backpack, after quite some time, Otis decided to try on waterproof trousers. So I had to wait for that. Ridiculous, honestly.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Next, we went to Uniqlo! Super exciting! My first time in the Edinburgh shop. Spoiler: I didn't get anything. My goal was to find some shirts for the West Highland Way. Breathable stuff.

                    <figcaption>I quite liked this shirt, but I decided it wasn't a colour I'd wear much (not at all the colour in these photos).</figcaption>

                </figure>

                I think about these trousers a lot.... Unfortunately, they were just too short. They look fine here, but they were just a little too obviously short. The shirt, however, was great!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                So yeah, I lied, I did buy something. However, it was not at all for the WHW.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4295.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Proof it was actually Uniqlo.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Now approaching 5, we decided to head back towards home.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4296.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>No comment. Oh yes, this is so cool!</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Along Cockburn Street, we stopped to window shop.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4297.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                Also to actually shop. I bought a plant pot for my very in need of re-potting plants. Only £5! (Not factorial.)
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                You might have noticed that I hadn't had lunch yet. I also noticed this. I was very responsible and got lunch! Hm, no, I did not. I decided to get bubble tea. For free! Well, I bought a mochi & another for Otis at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qb862yAHkUWqWTcX8">Meet Fresh Edinburgh</a>. Then I got the free drink using a voucher given at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1mGEPj1bpR9RPBE6A">Aihua</a> with you a few weeks (months?) back. This made up for the lack of good coop vouchers.

                </figure>

                Outside, I discovered something incredible!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                <video width="500" controls class="center">
                    <source src="Videos\IMG_2224.MOV" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I had to record it a few times. Here was the first attempt:
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                <video width="500" controls class="center">
                    <source src="Videos\IMG_2219.MOV" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                You can hear people approach off screen. I didn't want them to hear my discovery obviously. No other reason for stopping. Awkward? Embarrassed? No, never!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I dropped off my friend, what's his name? Oh, Otis. Yeah, I dropped him off at home. Then I went to my own. There, I called you for a bit. I'm sure that was nice, though I cannot remember any details. 
                

                <h4 class = "h4font">Evening</h4>

                That evening, I went to work. On the way, I saw some pretty flowers. 

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\IMG_2227.jpg" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                Then I saw some pretty ones on the way home.

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4314.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>This was really hard to get into focus.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                And some Jesus rays (wrong word, it is God rays, but anyway, crepuscular rays is the better word):

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4316.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>Edinburgh skyline.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                The plan for that evening was to meet Lalit for a final goodbye. Otis, Lalit, and I were going to drink the ginger beer from September-ish time that Lalit had somewhat participated in the making of. We were going to go up the Crags for this. Probably to watch the sunset. Unfortunately, times didn't work very well and we realised we were going to miss it. Then Lalit needed more time. Then it started to rain. So we went to Otis's and drank there.

                    <figcaption>We also tried the cider again, which was great.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                Not wanting this to be the real goodbye, we decided to meet the next day to see the sofa! 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I went home happy because I hadn't said goodbye yet. I then didn't go to bed and instead made my calendars!

                </figure>

                And then, presumably, I went to bed.
            </p>

                This wasn't the most eventful day, but lots was done! I was really tired that evening & didn't enjoy the Lalit time much unfortunately, so I was very glad to make plans to see him again. Lalit also gave us each photos he'd taken of us. So sweet!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!
