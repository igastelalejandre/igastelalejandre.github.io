                <h4 class = "h4font">Morning Stress</h4>

                Otis and I had decided to continue our West Highland Way prep by doing another hike. Lacking inspiration, we decided to walk around Edinburgh and do some tasks. Having chipped my tooth the night before, I was anxious to get an appointment at the dentist. First, I had to get a dentist (3 years of procrastination). I spent the morning calling a few offices to get set up. This was actually simple (once they picked up)! Having secured an appointment, I braced myself for eating breakfast (with very careful chewing).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                My next task of the morning was to pick up the Söderberg bread from Otis's, as I deal with most of the distributing. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                After that, I needed to go via yours for a crochet hook (spoiler, still not used). Outside, the sky had an <u>incredible</u> cloud.

                <h4 class = "h4font">The Walk to Kings</h4>

                Finally, several hours after our initially planned meeting, we finally got on our way to Kings. The route was going to be Kings (to drop off bread), <a href="https://g.co/kgs/87SDMW9">Tiso</a> (to buy a backpack), and then the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/6UkMcKA">Leith Army Stores</a> (to browse). Notice <q>going to be</q>.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                As is looking standard with us, we did not have much of a lunch prepared. In our ambling down towards Kings, we passed by <a href="https://g.co/kgs/iE1wPk9">Touch of Poland</a>.

                Having never gone in, we decided to finally explore it! What a treasure trove!

                </figure>

                They had so many pretzels! So many pickles and other pickled things! A pistachio liquor I was really tempted to buy.... So many exciting items to get back to!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                After a nice long look, we left with our purchases.

                After this stop, there is little to comment on about the walk down. It was, as usual, shorter than expected.

                We started out by dropping off the bread in the common room (still debating whether it is postgrad only or not). Then we said hi to Christina (who is working in the JCMB this summer). Finally, we prepared some lunch things in the Mathshub microwaves! This involved coffee, instant, and my food, because I'd actually brought lunch this time (leftovers from the Lalit lunch).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                As it was a super nice day now, we decided to get a picnic table to eat outside.

                One of our Taste of Poland spoils was pickles (technically cornichons in English, I believe). I was super excited & had high hopes. They let me down. :(

                </figure>

                Being summer (not actually technically yet), there was no milk to have with the coffee. So, I tried adding some of my drinkable yoghurt (strawberry) as an alternative... I wouldn't do it again.

                </figure>

                After lunch, Otis and I went back to Mathshub to clean our things. Once there, we decided to finish our West Highland Way planning (I say finish... more like start & finish). Fortunately, my fears weren't founded and our first pick for dates worked with all of the campsites. Now booked, I felt more relaxed.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                WHW planning/booking and our extended lunch in the sun had now left us at 6pm or so. A bit tired & feeling accomplished (these bookings had been weighing on us both), we decided to scrap our other stops and head home.


                <h4 class = "h4font">The Evening</h4>

                That evening I wrote + worked on my website and made dinner.

                The only other interesting thing to note was the pretty sunset.

                This was sort of a tiring day. I didn't feel super accomplished because I only did small-ish tasks, mostly ones I'd been putting off. It was quite a nice day though, and it was nice to go into Touch of Poland finally!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!

                As I recall, this day was really tiring and sort of sad feeling other than the excitement of going into Touch of Poland. I really like the photo of me wearing your hoodie though. And the sunset is <u>beautiful</u>.
