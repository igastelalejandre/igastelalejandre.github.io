                <h4 class = "h4font">Late Start</h4>

                I woke up pretty late on this day. After preparing some breakfast (around 11), I sat down at my desk to write for a long time (just like I am now hahaha). Zander was set to arrive at mine around 1 (or just before). So, at about quarter to, I decided I needed to actually put on clothes and things. You know, set (give?) a good impression. I also wanted to clean up the flat a bit. So, I rushed around and did that. Somehow very, very quickly.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                During this time, the post arrived, including something surprising, but this time, good! A letter from Charlie! All the way from Indonesia! I absolutely love getting letters and I'd forgotten that I'd given my address to him for this exact reason. It was also nice to hear from him as he's not a huge texter. Just as I finished reading it, Zander arrived!


                <h4 class = "h4font">Zander</h4>

                We chatted a bit, planned when he'd be able to go back to the flat, etc. I'd told him I was going to leave mine at 1, so he assumed I had plans with someone. I did not. I was going to <a href="https://g.co/kgs/V6djJzq">Knoops</a> to take advantage of their free iced hot chocolate offer. I invited him along.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I liked him! He was a good conversationalist. Very friendly, very interesting. It was nice to spend time with a person when I had been planning on being alone till work. And it was nice to spend time with a <u>new</u> person. This makes it sound like I was expecting to not like him. That's not the case. I just sort of figured we'd talk for five minutes and that would be it. But no! And it was nice!

                After Knoops, we walked down to South Bridge so that Zander could get some <a href="https://g.co/kgs/smMFtsy">Greggs</a>. I would've too if they had their cheese and onion bake, but they didn't. Then we walked over to sit in <a href="https://g.co/kgs/UGCV1qc">Princes Street Gardens</a>.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                It was honestly a perfect, beautiful day. Some clouds, but blue skies. People milling about. Perfect temperature.

                After finishing his lunch, Zander decided he wanted to go towards to the Meadows. 

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN3996.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\DSCN4000.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">
                    <figcaption>One thing I like maybe <u>more</u> than plants growing on roofs, walls, etc. is bridge buildings (and building bridges!).</figcaption>
                </figure>

                At the Meadows, we sat and bathed in the sunlight. Zander was pleased with the Victorian paperweight he'd bought on the way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockburn_Street,_Edinburgh">Cockburn Street</a>. Taylor Swift was a major portion of our conversation at one point (due to her playing at <a href="https://g.co/kgs/fJvQFn6">Murrayfield</a> that night and loads of people about in Swiftie outfits). A bigger portion of the conversations was you. How does that make you feel? Big and powerful I hope. Ok that was sort of weird. Anyway, we got up and walked towards Tollcross. I went into the Scotmid to buy tomatoes. We said goodbye till later so I could go to work.


                <h4 class = "h4font">Work</h4>

                Since I was in the area, I asked them about going early (at 4). This was a much better time than the original 5. Perfect, in fact, because I had only had tomatoes since (a very late) breakfast, and had an hour & a half long shift so hunger didn't kill me. Phewph.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                At work I also listened to music, which I hadn't yet done. This made the shift much better. Unfortunately, I also think it distracted me enough to lock myself out when I went out with the bin.

                I went home via <a href="https://g.co/kgs/8MyuxPV">Lidl</a> for some food for dinner.

                <h4 class = "h4font">Flatten Earth Takes Over Dagda Bar</h4>

                At home, I had my dinner. Then I wrote some more as I got live updates about the Taylor Swift concert from my friends on the west side of the Meadows. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I was meeting Flatten Earth people at 8 at <a href="https://g.co/kgs/SpiZAqn">Dagda Bar</a>, but classically, no one was going to be on time. So I had fun changing outfits! And I wore a <u>skirt</u>. Wow. That was fun!

                <figure>
                    <img src="Images\ExcitingSkirt.JPG" style="width:500px;" class="center">

                </figure>

                Dagda Bar was fun! was nice seeing the people after a few weeks having not. I thought a lot about you because of the time I saw you outside it and we talked for <u>ages</u> (still think about that a lot & it makes me smile) (also that time I was meeting Leon to debrief & stuff and you were on our list of topics hehe) and another time I was there and was going to stay at yours & needed to procure a toothbrush (I don't really remember the details of that visit).

                I then went to yours to get a duvet for Zander (but got a blanket instead). And then I went home.

                I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Zander! I enjoyed Dagda Bar. I was so very excited to see you the next day. It was so very exciting!!! Wee woo!

                This post is the one where I've taken the most liberties in editing. I'm growing fonder of this as time goes on because honestly I just read my writing and <u>do</u> want to edit it. Lightly, but some. And that's fine. Still, no major changes. I'm not allowing myself to remove sections nor add new ones, but I have been changing words and phrases.
