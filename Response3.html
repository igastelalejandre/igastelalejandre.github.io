                Though the cows you met were indeed excited to see you, I'm sure there are times when they know <u>not</u> 
                to be excited by the approach of humans. I am very impressed by your research here. Very much appreciated. 
                :)

                Do you know if little other than barley is grown on Orkney because of the weather? I would assume (and 
                hope) so. I like the idea that cows take up such a large portion of the word & land, but the fact is that 
                most probably die (that is, are killed) is a natural next thought, and that is not pleasant. (What's the 
                word for next thought? I think it starts with p, but my brain won't come up with it.) (I believe I meant 
                <q>progression</q> instead of <q>next thought</q>.)

                I'm not convinced of ChatGPT's responses to why cows have black tongues. But you know else is not fully 
                understood? The moon, and more so, milk, which is also cow related.

                Hahaha, I didn't even see your next line. Glad we're on the same page.

                Unsure what made you think cows were wet in a dignified sense. In fact I'm not sure how one <u>can</u> be 
                wet in a dignafied sense.

                This first paragraph is <u>ridiculously</u> funny! I laughed. If I were the cows, I would also be engrossed 
                by you. Though you may be referring to the 4:1 ratio of cows to humans on Orkney, I'd like to add that you 
                are a particularly interesting human (though the cows probably can't tell that). <q>Little bovine minds</q> 
                hehe :) very Beef & Dairy. Very funny & cute.

                Personally, I'm more of a fan of these cows, though they seem much less interesting (and interested? - 
                perhaps they see humans more often than the others).

                <h4 class = "h4font">My Own Thoughts</h4>
                
                This post has made me much fonder of cows (actually it is mostly due to the WhatsApp photos and videos). 
                You know I love lambs (and sheep), and that is the reason I don't eat their meat (though I also don't like 
                the taste). The same goes for rabbits. Perhaps by the end of summer the same will be true of cows. I'd like 
                to be truly fully pescatarian, but occasionally I do really want meat, and as this is about once every 4 
                months, I'm hesitant to stop myself. The real meat consumption on my end is other people feeding me. But 
                fortunately that is also uncommon-ish. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Funnily, Flatten Earth talk yesterday revolved around the idea of putting the names of animals on their 
                meat's packaging. Giving a sense of humanity to make people more grateful & thoughtful. It's an interesting 
                thought. I don't think they realised that most of the cows won't have names, just numbers. And 
                unfortunately I don't think people would care much after getting desensitised.

                This time, I wrote my responses by <a href="Hand-Written Response 3.pdf">hand</a> and then typed them up 
                and uploaded. Much more effective! And much more fun! I am more creative and real when I write by hand. 
                What I write is much more like how I think and speak. How I text is different. And how I was type 
                responding was much more like that. I believe I will continue in this way from now on!
