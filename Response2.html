                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I'd love to take a plane to Kirkwall just to watch the propellers! Unfortunately not worth the price. I 
                wonder why they don't use slightly smaller planes? I do like that they emptiness brings about 
                conversation with co-travellers. But perhaps that is you and your easy conversing. Note: tell airport boy 
                story (not as interesting as the title).

                I like your comment on Manchester's idyllicism. I thought the same and then read it. Very funny :) 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Kirkwall's airport seems to be even smaller than Zaragoza's! Haven't been to it in a while, so may be 
                somewhat wrong, but it was literally one room. Tall ceilings did make it feel more spacious though (from 
                my short, young height). Note: tell Zaragoza airport story, 2010. Alright, a quick google search has shown 
                me that actually Zaragoza's airport is much bigger than I remember, which is still sort of tiny. But it's 
                much nicer than Kirkwall's. I think Spain has lots of nice airports, lots of glass and high ceilings.

                put out the bin on Wednesday.</q> The straightforwardness, the slight humour, the fact that things don't

                I appreciate the hyperlink, it prompted me to (half) read the Wikipedia article in which I learned about 
                the dungeons, which I now very much want to see. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I'm impressed by the cathedral's age, and curious to see the evolution of time in its architectural 
                styles.

                The St Magnus Way! Sounds great! I love when walks have pathstones & logos. El Camino De Santiago has a

                Unsure if I said this in Oban (or another time), but named routes are also very much irresistible for me. 
                (to me?) Also, (hehe :)) I did keep changing Magnus to Mungus in my head up until now.

                <h4 class = "h4font">Around the Cathedral</h4>

                On reading this section, I must say I may disagree about the cathedral being the prettiest part of 
                Kirkwall. The house in this section looks lovely! I obviously <u>love</u> the vines. I love coloured windows & 
                doors. I very much like the stone. The gate, the stoned up window or maybe door on the street. So so cute. 
                The crooked windows! (Love the word <q>blustery</q>.)

                Recently I was thinking about how local supermarkets are missing so much, are quite cramped, but also seem 
                to never have what you need. So what do they sell? Tins and tins of baked beans, soups, spaghetti-os, it 
                seems. Then large supermarkets are huge and don't seem to have much more. I feel they just don't want to 
                stock much more, so they widen the aisles (immensely). I miss non plastic packaged fruit & veg and more 
                variety of those things. And also cheese counters. My childhood holiday memories are filled (!) with 
                these. I'm glad the co√∂p had eggs. Unsurprised the member price is the same, surprised regular price is. 
                Is Orkney as of yet similarly priced? I'm always surprised to find lack of fluctuations in supermarket 
                prices across Scotland (other than small to large shops).

                <h4 class = "h4font">Weather</h4>

                I particularly like your sentences at the beginning of this section. Good style (humour). Wind turbines! 
                So exciting! The story I think I never finished on the bus from Glasgow to Edinburgh was this: when I was 
                younger, my cousins and I would play wind turbine counting games (very simple, one just counts the 
                turbines and whomever counts the most wins). We never set a time limit because we always got into too high 
                numbers & got bored. On the drive from Fife to Queensferry a few weeks ago, I told Otis this and we played 
                (well... we is an overstatement). I counted 33, he got 3. I won. I always think of how funny it is that 
                Spain has so much wind power and Scotland has focused more on solar (from my biased solar research last 
                summer anyway).

                The old grocer is very cool. I like the colours, I like the sign! I really like the symmetry & lines, the

                on right.

                I really appreciate the photos! I like how nice they are! The composition of all of them was honestly 
                phenomenal and it has inspired me to try to keep to nice photos to send to you (and slightly inspired by
                my worry of being overwhelming). I think the photos capture the mood you are painting of Kirkwall (town,
                not city!) very well.

                to hear about them. I'm excited to see it all myself (ofc, ofc, ofc!!!), mist, grey skies, etc. I'm sure

                I want to note that I hand-wrote this response first, but I will not be doing that in future. Rewriting 
                the whole thing today in here has taken approximately 4 and a half hours so far and the hand-writing took
                over 3 (though that included reading), and I spent several hours last night as well converting it into an 
                email! Unfortunately, it is a little bit tiring, so I cannot do both! I did really want to have them 
                hand-written as well though! I assume I will be speedier in future as today I have spent a lot of time 
                looking for answers to questions on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> and figuring out 
                how to adapt my hand-written format to my brand new website!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I originally intended to keep the format from the hand-written response to a tee, I even planned to 
                include all my misspellings and accidental deviations in format! I went so far as to add little blocks of 
                black to replace crossed out words in the email format I started. In the end, I have decided to very 
                slightly edit what I originally wrote to fix the errors and, as this is technically public to anyone, 
                improve readability. I also ended up removing a short section at the end which seemed confusing given the 
                content (it was about the handwriting and the errors which I have just said have been fixed in this 
                version). For this reason, I have decided to include a scanned version of my <a
