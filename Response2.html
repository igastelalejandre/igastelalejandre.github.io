                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Glad you have become a true local with your camera, fanny pack, and packed lunch (unlike the tourists, 
                bleh).

                Sounds like it was super windy! Wind easily makes my ears and (after) head hurt. Absolutely terrible! I'm 
                going to have to bring earplugs on the West Highland Way. I'm also going to bring a bunch of clips to keep
                my fringe out of my face because it makes it really hard to see whenever it is moderately windy. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Super exciting stuff about Orkney exceeding energy demand in 2013! I would assume this is actually 
                electricity demand, but regardless, I am very impressed. I hope they've been close to meeting it every 
                year since. One wind turbine for every thirty people seems like a lot, but Orkney has a small population...

                [I realise I hadn't seen Oribital's logo yet, but I found it very surprising when I first saw this photo, I

                blue skies. The blue door adds a touch of colour, but unfortunately, in particular as it is paired with 
                those pipe-y rails, it reminds me of New York City public schools, and not in a good way] -- <i>grey</i>

                I was unaware of your massive bird of prey fear (sounds similar to your mushroom one), but surprised to 
                hear the turbine reminded you of them. Glad to hear you moved before the blades fell on your head. It would 
                definitely not be a good look to have the new intern die by turbine on their very first day. I wish you to 
                stay alive for the remainder too though! Please please!

                <h4 class = "h4font">Macros</h4>

                I read this entire section before starting my response, which I think is a better way of responding than 
                what I did with the previous section, where I responded live as I read every three or so lines. This allows 
                me to make some more general statements, such as this one: I really like that you use the word <q>about</q> 
                and then give a very non specific (or non scientific) amount, I find this very funny (but careful not to 
                overdo it, though that's unlikely when I'm the sole audience). 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I find it very cute that you went out with your camera (and fanny pack and packed lunch, to give the 
                non-toursit aesthetic) and didn't get your phone. I'm very glad you spent the time taking the photos and 
                seeing the outdoors (though also a bit surprised given the cold and wind). And I like that you say 
                <q>macro tubes</q>.

                I'm glad to finally see some bike paths! It sounded earlier like there were none. However, perhaps the rain 
                and wind stop many people from cycling, and so the town sees less of a need to build cycling 
                infrastructure] -- <i>bike</i>

                Your half paragraph about hydrogen is funny. I really like the style of asking questions in the midst of 
                text and not necessarily answering them. It is always fun to see things you're related to advertised or 
                showing up publically or being talked about by others. Even when you haven't done anything, it still feels 
                a reason to feel pride. 
                <br>


                <h4 class = "h4font">Demographics</h4>

                What age group are you referring to as yours? The real question is, how large an age range is that. I am 
                completely unsurprised that the population is heavily old-person represented. I am surprised that the 
                population is growing at all. I assume it will soon stop though, once the large group of older people are 
                dying faster than people immigrate in and are born. I will say, 200,000 people sounds like a lot, and I 
                suppose since they're concentrated over 3 months, it is, but over the whole year, even when the population 
                is 1/10th of that, it's not actually that impressive. Particularly since, as you said, most of the tourists 
                arrive on cruises, and those people live on the cruises (not in permant homes on land).

                Yay!!! You will tourist and write (weee) wooo!!! Of course, unlike the other tourists, you have a camera,

                <h4 class = "h4font">Boats</h4>

                It's funny how we say sailing even when we talk about boating not on sailboats (originally spelled botes, 
                though boating was spelled correctly from that start). 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>

                as usual I liked the humour in that phrase. This is also a very pretty photo, and it reminds me of the New 
                York City bay, particularly looking out towards Ellis Island. I attempted to find a photo similar to what I 
                was thinking about, but failed] -- <i>lighthouse</i>

                One thing I really liked was the use of &#8482 in <b>The Path Home</b>. I thought I was 
                adding the emoji, but it ended up being real text with font style just like the rest of the sentence! I 
                really liked that.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Another thing I've done is to capitalise titles in your posts in ways I like more when I refer to them in 
                my section titles. I had somewhat of an internal conflict over whether to write <i>exactly</i> what you'd 
                written, or to write what I thought looked best (and had no ufnctional difference). In the end I decided on 
                the latter, and have gone back to <a 
                href="https://igastelalejandre.github.io/Response1.html">Response 1</a> to update this decision there too. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I also decided to proofread, inline with my decision to make some edits yesterday to my original 
                hand-written response. I am not allowing myself, however, to make huge changes (unless they are merely 
                additions), excpet for in extenuating circumstances (which of course I decide on).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                With respect to the actual writing, I have definitely got the hang of this now. It's really quite simple, I 
                only really use line breaks, dividers, underlines, italics, some different header styles, etc. (Note: 
                &#60u&#62love&#60/u&#62 gives uwu.) However, I feel I am less inspired in my writing than when I write by 
                hand. I don't know if you will notice this, but I do feel this response was much more lacklustre. However, 
                this may also be due to the fact that I wrote the first half past midnight when I was quite tired of 
                looking at my screen (for what ended up totaling 8 hours). Anyway, I will see how it goes with the next one 
                (maybe even speedier than this!) and then decided if I want to write them out by hand beforehand. To be 
                honest, it wouldn't be too bad anyway, because the typing up is pretty fast, so far it's been really long 
                only because I've been getting used to all these new things (super fun!!!) and figuring out formatting and 
                things. We shall see!
