                I backdate my posts!


                <h4 class = "h4font">Hike</h4>

                I'm surprised there is not footpath up (?) <u>not</u> through fields (empty or not).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I absolutely love that reddish/purple grass!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Elusive, a beautiful word (and includes "v"!)!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                [careful, my mother would worry!] -- <i>purple</i>
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I completely agree, no need for navigation. You see the destination, you can make it fine. For some reason I have a feeling you'll find our you're wrong, and probably it has to do with going through a field, sorry <q>footpath</q>.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                I am <u>so</u> surprised to hear this hill is as tall as Arthur's Seat. That's insane!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                [not until this photo did I understand the name of the house, which I must say is incredibly funny given the rock that was found there (and presumably saved)] -- <i>saverock</i>


                <h4 class = "h4font">Ruins</h4>

                [fence is a nice touch] -- <i>barn</i>
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                [I am deeply reminded of Cramond, though this barn is clearly quite new] -- <i>corner</i>
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                According to my quick research, the word <q>ruin</q> holds no time meaning. Thus, I'd say this barn <u>can</u> be called a ruin.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                The trees and greenery are very pretty, in particular the large branch-y one.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                [this concrete arch is quite creepy, it reminds me of a mausoleum, or at least the entrance to a graveyard] -- <i>entrance</i>

                <h4 class = "h4font">Cows</h4>

                Excited to continue reading about your revelation with respect to Orkney's fun! I so expect it to be cow related (probably because of the title of this section).
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>

                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Your description of the cow approach is incredibly accurate, I can see your many experiences have left a mark.


                <h4 class = "h4font">Quarry</h4>

                The Scottish policies on outdoors are so great and something I'm so grateful for. I am so glad to have the leniency of camping almost anywhere and going to places however I like. Paired with the free bus... heaven for exploration lovers like me! Something I don't think about much because I basically have no other experience, but definitely something I cherish and want in anywhere I decide to live in for a long time (over 2 years).

                Small fluffy creatures? My socks say clouds or sheep.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Omg! I just noticed that the maps are actually maps and not images! So cool! I love the little turbine symbols in them. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                [this very flat path to the quarry is not that inviting] -- <i>concrete</i>

                Your safety training doesn't seem to extend far, I would recommend some more.

                <h4 class = "h4font">Stone</h4>

                My quick calculations told me that if the Â£9B were distributed evenly across all Orcadians, they would each get about half a million (400,000 or so). With that money, I would not build a car of stone, but that's just me.

                Having seen a few hailbows myself, I wonder how rare they really are.

                My favourite part of this post was discovering the fun alt text halfway through. After, I liked going through and reading them all & seeing references that I'd also noticed / thought of / written down.

                My favourite photo was the final one.
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Much love!

                Here is my original hand-written <a href="Handwritten Scans\Hand-Written Response 6.pdf">response</a>. 
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Did you notice that your final use of <q>cows</q> was for the section titled <b>Cows</b>? (Plural is important.) (Update, this is not true at all and I have absolutely no idea how I saw it to be true. I am ashamed of myself, but I tell you anyway because I trust you? Or something like that. Anyway, I also do love you, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason.)

                Re: backdating: I said I wrote this on the 8th of July, I definitely didn't finish it then. I finished it on the 19th of July. I am not sure if I perhaps started it on the 8th and that's how I chose the date. I am surprised that I didn't finish it on the day I started though, so I am entirely confused. It doesn't matter too much though, so it's fine!
                <br><div class="spacer"></div>
                Finally, please let me know if you can read the 7th word in my hand-written copy, because I cannot and just put the closest word, which doesn't make sense.
